            <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is RS Underground?</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">RS Underground was formed in late 2023 by a group of players with a passion for breaking rules. Runescape is full of bugs
                glitches, and terrible anti-botting measures. We aim to exploit this to it's full extent not just for monetary gain, but
                for renown and bragging rights. Our members are from every walk of life, from simple players to programmers and career hackers.
                With this selection of people, we are confident we can give Jagex a run for their money, and cause enough havoc to bring ourselves
                to the spotlight.
